# Normalize line endings
* text=auto eol=lf

# This makes sure all text files (Java, TS, HTML, etc.) use LF internally
# Git will automatically convert LF <-> CRLF depending on your OS when checking out
# Why? Prevents messy CRLF warnings like you saw earlier.

# Mark Windows batch scripts to always use CRLF
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.bat text eol=crlf

# Because these are Windows-specific scripts (like mvnw.cmd),
# they MUST have CRLF, otherwise Windows might break.

# Mark all source code as text
*.java text
*.ts text
*.html text
*.css text
*.scss text
*.json text
*.yml text
*.xml text
*.md text

# This explicitly says these are normal text files.
# Git will normalize them to LF internally.

# Mark binary files
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
*.pdf binary
*.docx binary
*.xlsx binary

# These are binary filesâ€”Git should NOT try to diff or normalize line endings.

# Special GitHub diff settings (optional)
*.lock -diff
*.min.js -diff

# Package-lock.json or minified JS are machine-generated,
# so no need to show diffs in PRs.
